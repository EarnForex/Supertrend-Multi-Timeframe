# Supertrend Multi-Timeframe

Supertrend Multi-Timeframe is a custom MetaTrader indicator based on the [original Supertrend Line indicator](https://www.earnforex.com/metatrader-indicators/supertrend/) for MT4 and MT5, coded by EarnForex.com. The indicator consists of an MTF panel and the current timeframe Supertrend line on the chart.

This version of Supertrend Multi-Timeframe is available for the MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 platforms. It supports all three alert types: native, mobile, and email.
